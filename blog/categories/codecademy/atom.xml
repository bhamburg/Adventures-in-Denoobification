    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Despite marching in a parade with Fralinger and plans to go out with some friends tonight, I still managed to get through Level 1 and 2 of <a href="http://rubybits.codeschool.com/">Ruby Bits</a> since I already have a <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a> subscription. I figured it would make sense to learn as much as I can using Code School and Codecademy as a primer before plunking down the cash for the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Pragmatic Studio</a> course that I intend to take.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been told there is no such thing as a bad workout and I suppose the same goes for a coding session. Even though I didn&rsquo;t have much time today, I still learned some important Ruby concepts such as the implied <code>nil</code> and short-circuit evaluation. Onward and upward tomorrow.</p>
