Despite marching in a parade with Fralinger and plans to go out with some friends tonight, I still managed to get through Level 1 and 2 of [Ruby Bits](http://rubybits.codeschool.com/) since I already have a [Code School](http://codeschool.com) subscription. I figured it would make sense to learn as much as I can using Code School and Codecademy as a primer before plunking down the cash for the [Pragmatic Studio](http://pragmaticstudio.com/) course that I intend to take.

I've been told there is no such thing as a bad workout and I suppose the same goes for a coding session. Even though I didn't have much time today, I still learned some important Ruby concepts such as the implied `nil` and short-circuit evaluation. Onward and upward tomorrow.
