From [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=denoobification):

>**denoobification**
>
>The process by which someone becomes less of a noob, or in some extremely successful cases, becomes 0% noob. The process usually takes a bit of time, to get rid of the noobish habits and tendencies of the subject. Successful processes make the subject someone more people in the online community like, while failed cases mysteriously become more noobish than when they began the process.
