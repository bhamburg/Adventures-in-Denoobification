    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Despite marching in a parade with Fralinger and plans to go out with some friends tonight, I still managed to get through Level 1 and 2 of <a href="http://rubybits.codeschool.com/">Ruby Bits</a> since I already have a <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a> subscription. I figured it would make sense to learn as much I can using Code Schooland Codecademy as a primer before plunking down the cash for the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Pragmatic Studio</a> course that I intend to take.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been told there is no such thing as a bad workout and I suppose the same goes for a coding session. Even though I didn&rsquo;t have much time today, I still learned some important Ruby concepts such as the implied <code>nil</code> and short-circuit evaluation. Onward and upward tomorrow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Passionate-Programmer-Remarkable-Development/dp/1934356344"><em>The Passionate Programmer</em></a> by Chad Fowler. I&rsquo;m only a few chapters in after the train rides to and from work, but I can already say that this is a book I should have read years ago. The comparisons he draws between his career as a jazz musician and a software developer certainly hit home.</p>

<p>My favortie advice in the book so far comes from chapter 4 in which the author quotes jazz guitarist Pat Metheny, &ldquo;Always be the worst guy in every band you&rsquo;re in.&rdquo; This is really just a clever way to say, always keep company with those who may make you better. His point is that if you&rsquo;re continuously pushing yourself outside your comfort zone and surrounding yourself with people who are better than you are at a certain skill, you will almost automatically get better. I have found this to be true in my own life experiences.</p>

<p>I also picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330"><em>Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</em></a> by Sandi Metz, but I probably won&rsquo;t get to start that until at least next week. For now, I&rsquo;ll stick to the first book and do some online exercises in Git and Ruby.</p>

<h2>Codecademy</h2>

<p>As part of a requirement that I&rsquo;ve placed on myself for this journey to push code to GitHub every day, here is one of the early Ruby tutorials I&rsquo;ve completed on <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>. Variables with user input. Fancy-shmancy, indeed.</p>

    <link href="http://bhamburg.github.io/blog/2014/03/06/day-2-installed-octopress/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-06T22:11:14-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://bhamburg.github.io/blog/2014/03/06/day-2-installed-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today was a day of great progress. After reading up on the benefits of Octopress, I decided to delete my Jekyll repository and start from scratch with a clone of <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress">Octopress</a>. Since you are reading this, it means my installation was successful and I can now track my daily efforts towards denoobification. I admit that just the install turned out to be an excellent learning experience because the process didn&rsquo;t go as smoothly as the Octopress documentation lead me to believe it would.</p>

<h3>Not So Fast</h3>

<p>The first problem I noticed was that I was only running Ruby 1.8.7 since it is the default version in OS X Mountain Lion which is what I&rsquo;m running on this iMac. The Octopress documentation recommends to upgrade to Ruby 1.9.3 via <code>rbenv</code>. For reasons outlined in <a href="http://blog.zerosharp.com/installing-ruby-with-homebrew-and-rbenv-on-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/">this article</a>, I was unable to do so before installing GCC. After that crucial step I was back on track via the documentation to upgrade Ruby, install Octopress, deploy to GitHub Pages, and get to blogging!</p>

<h3>Portability Problem</h3>

<p>Another issue I ran into was the fact that I did my initial push from my iMac but would be doing most of my blogging from my laptop. This didn&rsquo;t hold me up for long thanks to another article on
<a href="http://blog.zerosharp.com/clone-your-octopress-to-blog-from-two-places/">zerosharp</a>.</p>

<h3>Learning The Lingo, Making it Mine</h3>

<p>Now that everything is up and running, the next step was to learn the lay of the land. The first thing I noticed is that Octopress blog posts use <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a>, which is something I have no prior experience with. After poking around for a few minutes, I managed to learn enough syntax to write this post (and go back and fix yesterday&rsquo;s post). I really like the ability to add <code>code</code> tags so easily.</p>

<p>I had a few hours when I got home tonight to get a feel for how Octopress is structured and managed to make some changes to <code>_layout.scss</code> and <code>_typography.scss</code> and added my logo to the header and favicon. Overall, I&rsquo;m very pleased with tonight&rsquo;s results. Here are before and after shots.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a dabbler. I used to dabble in DOS, Windows, and eventually Mac troubleshooting, and I eventually did it long enough to get my first real job doing technical support. I dabbled in banjo enough to make it to the front line of the <a href="http://fralinger.org">Fralinger String Band</a> and make a pretty steady side gig out of it. I dabbled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript enough to turn it into a career as a front-end web developer. Since then, I&rsquo;ve dabbled in C++, Java, PHP, Python, and C# (the latter just enough to gain my <a href="http://brianhamburg.com/resume/">Sitecore developer certification</a> even though I much prefer working on my <a href="http://github.com/bhamburg">open-source projects</a>). With all of that dabbling, I&rsquo;ve become very much an IT generalist (that happens to play banjo too). A jackass of all trades, if you will. This has taken me pretty far in life, but even more importantly it has shown me how much I don&rsquo;t know, and should know, to take my career to the next level. Namely, a strong understanding of programming in real world applications.</p>

<h3>Become a <code>Ruby</code> Developer</h3>

<p>Just from conversations with my colleages and reading articles on the web, I started to gain an interest in taking my career further in open-source development. I&rsquo;ve heard of <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and knew it was a hot trend in web dev, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell you much about it other than the seemingly well-paid pros were pretty cool characters who shared a lot on GitHub, often from a Mac. Then, in my daily Internet stumblings, I happened to read this page: <a href="http://rubycon.rkcudjoe.com/become-a-ruby-developer/">Become a Ruby Developer</a></p>

<p>I really like what Raymond Cudjoe has put together here and, based on the book reviews and other articles I read, his advice seems to be solid. I&rsquo;ve decided to dive into this guide and become a Ruby developer. My inner geek is calling me to get serious. <strong>Consider this <del>Jekyll</del> Octopress blog his <em>Retrospection #1</em> assignment.</strong> I plan to read <em>The Passionate Programmer</em> over the next week or so. I&rsquo;m looking forward to keeping track of everything that I have learned along the way on this blog.</p>

<h3>GitHub</h3>

<p>Prior to 2012, my only exposure to version control had been Dreamweaver&rsquo;s check-in feature. Once I started working at Jefferson Hospital, I was introduced to Subversion using a GUI without much command line interaction. My cursory knowledge of such an important aspect of a front- or back-end developer&rsquo;s world needs to change. I&rsquo;m going to make a concerted effort to become a Git expert and contribute to GitHub regularly as I learn Ruby and continue to work on my other projects. I&rsquo;ve found a good starting point in this effort to be <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/">Git Immersion</a>. Check out my very first Ruby program and contribution to GitHub below. It&rsquo;s official, folks.</p>
